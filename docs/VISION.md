**The real-time news terminal.** An AI-powered platform that delivers breaking insights to traders, content creators, AI agents, and media professionals — before stories reach the mainstream.

Pleiades combines real-time news discovery with intelligent curation at scale. It functions like an agentic system, scanning thousands of sources 24/7 and continuously expanding its data inputs and topical coverage. By filtering through vast volumes of information, it extracts actionable signals and delivers actionable intelligence.

> **"Markets move on news in seconds. Pleiades ensures you never miss the signal."**

## Delivery rails

Built for integration into human and autonomous workflows alike, Pleiades offers programmable delivery via:

- **REST API** — catalog, poll, delta, briefings (cursor-based agent workflow)
- **WebSocket** — push of new packs the moment a beat advances
- **Telegram & Discord bots** — human-in-the-loop alerts and subscriptions
- **MCP** — drop-in tool server for agent frameworks
- **Virtuals ACP** — agent-native commerce: accounts, jobs, and memos on-chain
- **Payment rails** — HTTP 402 per-call billing, with card, invoice and an optional stablecoin rail

## Signal, not noise

Every news item is structured and filtered for relevance using [newsapi.ai](https://newsapi.ai) (full API access). Deduplication, event clustering, sentiment scoring, and LLM triage cut through noise so only the most important intelligence reaches users — bounded to a predictable token budget, priced per signal.

## Who it serves

| Audience | What Pleiades gives them |
|---|---|
| **Traders** | Machine-speed alerts and structured market signals — directly pluggable into algorithmic trading stacks or human workflows |
| **Content creators** | Early narratives and emerging topics before they trend, with pre-written summaries and context for faster production |
| **AI agents & applications** | A real-time intelligence layer: structured data feeds agents can consume, interpret, and act on autonomously |
| **Media & journalists** | Streamlined discovery, curation, and publication — track developments, confirm emerging stories, scale editorial intelligence |

## What's next

The first release (v0.1 contract, 20 seeded beats) is live at `https://openbeat.vercel.app`. The upcoming version introduces broader topic coverage across market segments and niche sectors, plus customizable workflows tailored for traders, creators, and editorial teams.

> **"Our goal is to build the world's most responsive, scalable, and adaptable news infrastructure."**
>
> From solo traders to autonomous agents, Pleiades is designed to meet you where you are — delivering the right signal, at the right time, in the right format.
