# Pleiades

**News for your agents.** Connect an agent, discover a supported topic, read source-linked articles, and retrieve changes from a saved cursor.

## Customer news release

The current branch adds the redesigned website, news explorer, connection guide, v2 article stream and hosted MCP implementation. See [NEWS-ROLLOUT.md](docs/NEWS-ROLLOUT.md) for exact deployment status, validation evidence, operating limits and rollout steps. The migration and protected news backend are deployed and verified against real articles. Public access, recurring refresh and production homepage promotion await release approval.

- Website: `/` · news explorer: `/dashboard` · connections: `/connect` · guide: `/docs`
- Agent discovery: `/llms.txt` and `/skill.md`
- News API: `/v2/topics`, `/v2/news`, `/v2/changes`, `/v2/tools`
- MCP: `/mcp` (standard Streamable HTTP)
- [Integration examples](examples/README.md): TypeScript, MCP and OpenRouter tool calling

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
npm run verify:local
npm run dev:web
```

`verify:local` uses deterministic test data and performs no external model or provider requests. The SDK is a workspace package, not an npm-published package. The three interfaces also pass against the protected deployed service; specific agent-host installation and paid model inference remain unverified.

Supabase remains the backend and Vercel remains the intended website host. No existing v1 route or legacy worker is removed. The new `news-worker` is separately deployed and scheduled only after its first successful verification.

## Status

| Layer | State |
|---|---|
| Contract & schemas (`@pleiades/contracts`) | ✅ canonical v0.2 schema + 20 seed beats (mirrors the live v0.1 catalog) |
| API (`supabase/functions/api`) | ✅ serving `/health`, `/v1/catalog`, `/v1/tools`, `/v1/pricing`, `/openapi.json`; poll/delta serve **persisted packs** when Supabase is configured, honest `503` otherwise |
| Ingestion (`supabase/functions/worker`) | ✅ newsapi.ai fetch → event clustering → dedupe → pack → Supabase persistence; ledger billing loop pending (Phase 0/4) |
| Bots (`apps/bots`) | 🚧 Telegram/Discord delivery adapters; loop wired in Phase 3 |
| Webhooks | ✅ register/list/revoke on the API; HMAC-signed `pack.advanced` delivery from the worker |
| Realtime push | ✅ `@pleiades/realtime` client (pack inserts → canonical packs); Supabase Realtime enabled on `packs` |
| News MCP (`news-api`) | ✅ verified on the protected separate deployment; public-read release pending |
| x402 / ACP | 📋 legacy roadmap |
| Web (`apps/web`) | ✅ redesigned homepage, explorer and setup guide in Vercel preview |

**Legacy:** the audited v0.1 service ("OpenBeat") is live at `https://openbeat.vercel.app`. This repo is the v0.2 codebase; see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the cutover plan.

## Quickstart — local Node dev

```bash
npm install          # workspaces
npm run build        # contracts → sdk → apps
npm test             # contract tests (node --test)
npm run dev          # API at http://localhost:8787
npm run dev:web      # landing page at http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:worker   # dry-run ingestion (set NEWSAPI_API_KEY in .env)
```

Then:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/v1/catalog
curl http://localhost:8787/openapi.json
```

## Quickstart — Supabase (the runtime)

```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase deno   # one-time
supabase init && supabase link --project-ref <ref>
supabase db push
supabase secrets set NEWSAPI_API_KEY=<key>
supabase start                             # local Postgres + Realtime
supabase functions serve --no-verify-jwt   # api + worker locally
```

Full instructions, cron schedule, and deploy commands: [supabase/README.md](supabase/README.md).

## Generated code — keep it in sync

`supabase/functions/_shared/` is generated from `packages/contracts` + `apps/{api,worker}/src`.
After editing canonical sources:

```bash
npm run sync:supabase          # regenerate
npm run check:supabase         # CI enforces freshness with this
```

## Contributing

Work follows the phases in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md). Keep the `packages/contracts` schemas as the single source of truth — every surface (REST, WS, bots, ACP memos) reuses them.
