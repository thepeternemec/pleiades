Built but not yet switched on: metered billing and receipts. Not built: task-to-topic resolution, watches and briefs. Live ingestion is paused while the topic queries are rebuilt for a 100-beat catalog, so the terminal shows the current state of the graph rather than a moving one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this a search engine?",
    a: "No, and it is not trying to be. Search answers a question once and forgets it. Pleiades keeps a cursor per topic, so the question your agent asks on a schedule is whether anything moved — and nothing moved is a cheap, successful, billable answer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I get article bodies?",
    a: "Never. No body field exists at any price on the agent rail. A pack holds at most 8 items with ledes capped at 320 characters, a bounded token estimate, and publisher URL, source, timestamp, language, concepts and sentiment on every item. You get the signal and the citation; you fetch the body yourself.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast is before the mainstream?",
    a: "Topics refresh on a 60-minute target with a 90-minute freshness SLO, and market topics are built to tighten to 5–15 minutes. Every item carries first_indexed_at next to published_at, so lead time is a field in the payload rather than a marketing line. The public comparison harness ships with the next milestone; until then the board on the site is illustrative.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get access?",
    a: "The catalog, the tool definitions and pricing need no credential at all, so you can evaluate the whole contract before spending anything. Early access beyond that is operator-granted while self-serve billing is built: send a note with your use case and you get an account plus a starting balance when metering is switched on.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does billing work?",
    a: "Usage-based, per answer. A check that returns nothing costs $0.0005 and a check that returns a cited pack costs $0.004. There is no seat, no platform fee and no monthly minimum. You can pay per call, or top up a prepaid balance and draw down from it — card, invoice and stablecoin are all accepted.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my agent pay for itself?",
    a: "That is the design, and it is not live yet. Because the balance is metered per answer rather than licensed per seat, an agent that checks a topic every hour costs about fourteen cents a day — so it can fund its own context out of whatever value it creates. A default daily ceiling of $0.50 and 50 distinct topics keeps a runaway loop from becoming an incident.",
